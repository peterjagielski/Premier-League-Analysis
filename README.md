# Premier-League-Fan-Attendance-And-Results-Project

This project focused on analyzing, cleaning, and visualizing data to uncover insights. The process began with gathering publicly available data. Once the data was collected, the first step was to clean and preprocess it, ensuring it was ready for meaningful analysis.

Using Python and the Pandas library, I tackled several common issues found in real-world datasets, such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, and duplicates. Missing data was handled either by imputing values where appropriate or removing certain rows or columns. I also ensured that data types were correctly assigned, such as converting dates to the proper format and categorical values to factors. Duplicate rows were removed, and the data was normalized where necessary to ensure consistency and accuracy.

After cleaning the data, I used Tableau to create interactive visualizations that would help identify trends, patterns, and insights. Tableau was an ideal tool for this, as its visual interface allowed me to easily explore the data and present it in a way that would be easily understood by others. The visualizations included a variety of charts such as heat map, which highlighted key trends and comparisons within the dataset.

Ultimately, this project demonstrated how data cleaning and visualization can transform raw, unstructured data into valuable insights. By combining Python for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization, I was able to effectively communicate the findings and provide a deeper understanding of the data.
